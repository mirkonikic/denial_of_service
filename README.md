### mDOSv1
<br />

This is project i got assigned to do from University Professor of Operating Systems, since im interested so much in cyber security.
It's a dos attack written solely in low C.
There are libraries, but packets are manually created.
If you need help about understanding the code contact me i'll explain everything.

PLEASE IF YOU USE THIS DONT ATTACK OTHERS, THIS IS STRICTLY FOR "LEARNING AND FINDING WAY TO DEFEND AGAINST IT" PURPOSES
TEST IT ONLY ON YOUR COMPUTER, OR VIRTUAL MACHINE

`Tool i developed for executing denial of service attacks. ` <br />`
For now only one type of dos attacks is available: Sockstress.`<br />

**TODO**:
- [x] Fix Sockstress attack, RAM gets filled up quickly
- [ ] Add Syn Flood attack with spoofed ip addresses (dos)
- [ ] Try to add third to be Ping of Death
